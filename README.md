# DemoCalculator
A simple calculator.

This is a basic calculator which is intended to demonstrate some features found in C#.

Features:
- Able to perform basic math operations.
- There is a factorial function.
- Uses events, lambda expressions, and a recursive function which runs asynchronously.

Limitations:
- This is not a particularly useful calculator as there are countless better ones already in existence.
- There is certainly easier ways to achieve the same results, but they would be less "fun".
- There is no user input validation.
